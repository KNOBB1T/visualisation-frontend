To start using Visionet's Frontend, please run "npm install" to load all of the necessary dependencies required for it to run.

Ensure that the backend code is running on your localhost before running the code. If you start this before the backend, reload
your browser window to let them sync up together.

To run the frontend, simply run "npm run dev" into your terminal window.
Once Vite has successfully rendered an instance for you, click on the blue localhost link generated in the terminal window.

For if at any point you require the build files/ folder, run "npm run build" in the terminal.

Thank you, and hopefully you enjoy Visionet!

_Bugs to look out for_
if at any point the taxonomy doesn't load in the left handside of the Network View, reload the page until it generates.
This is due to the incosistency of the API calls between Visionet and NCBI/ Uniprot.

Considering that the app will continue development alongside the university, this will be aimed to be one of the first
fixes made.

Secondly, the taxonomy values on the Comparison View page may be flipped. This is apparent when you compare the species
genus or subgenus with the species name, as both should have similar, if not the same value.

Again, thank you!
